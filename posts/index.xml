      <description>Random thoughts about an old job that I sort of still have. I’ve changed names, just in case. I don’t want to piss anyone off. It’s also in a halting style. Each paragraph is less than 280 characters because I was going to post it all on micro.blog but I decided I didn’t want to spam anyone.
Years ago I worked for a 180 person consulting firm in the ERP space.</description>

      <description>I’ve always loved music, but I can pinpoint exactly when music became “more” for me. In 1984, when I was 13, my Aunt Pat was visiting my family in Columbus, GA and she and my Mom were going out shopping. Aunt Pat knew I liked music and offered to purchase me a 45. I told her I wanted either Love Somebody by Rick Springfield or Dancing in the Dark by Bruce Springsteen.</description>
